### Note: this plugin is obsolete since [native SmartSelect improvements were introduced](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_35#_smart-selection-for-javascript-and-typescript).

A much smarter, drop-in replacement to the default Expand/Shrink Selection commands.

Currently supported languages:
* Typescript (.ts, .tsx)
* JavaScript (.js, .jsx)
* JSON

For these languages, the TypeScript compiler is used to find smart selection expansions.

For unsupported languages, defaults to the original Expand/Shrink Selection.
